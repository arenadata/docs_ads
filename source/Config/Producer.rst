Producer Configs
==========================

Below is the configuration of the Java producer.

**key.serializer** -- Serializer class for key that implements the *org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer* interface

+ TYPE -- class
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**value.serializer** -- Serializer class for value that implements the *org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer* interface

+ TYPE -- class
+ IMPORTANCE -- high 

**acks** -- The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:

  + *acks=0* -- If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the *retries* configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to "-1"

  + *acks=1* -- This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost

  + *acks=all* -- This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. This is equivalent to the *acks=-1* setting

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- 1
+ VALID VALUES -- [all, - 1, 0, 1]
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**buffer.memory** -- The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will block for *max.block.ms* after which it will throw an exception.
This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression (if compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 33554432
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**compression.type** -- The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (i.e. no compression). Valid values are "none", "gzip", "snappy", or "lz4". Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression)

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- none
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**retries** -- Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting *max.in.flight.requests.per.connection* to "1" will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 0
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...,2147483647]
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**ssl.key.password** -- The password of the private key in the key store file. This is optional for client

+ TYPE -- password
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**ssl.keystore.location** -- The location of the key store file. This is optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for client

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**ssl.keystore.password** -- The store password for the key store file. This is optional for client and only needed if *ssl.keystore.location* is configured

+ TYPE -- password
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**ssl.truststore.location** -- The location of the trust store file

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**ssl.truststore.password** -- The password for the trust store file. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled

+ TYPE -- password
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- high

**batch.size** -- The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size. Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent. A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely). A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 16384
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**client.id** -- An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- ""
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**connections.max.idle.ms** -- Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 540000
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**linger.ms** -- The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay -- that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get *batch.size* worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will "linger" for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to "0" (i.e. no delay). Setting *linger.ms=5*, for example, would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to *5ms* of latency to records sent in the absence of load

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 0
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**max.block.ms** -- The configuration controls how long *KafkaProducer.send()* and *KafkaProducer.partitionsFor()* will block. These methods can be blocked either because the buffer is full or metadata *unavailable.Blocking* in the user-supplied serializers or partitioner will not be counted against this timeout

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 60000
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**max.request.size** -- The maximum size of a request in bytes. This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record batch size. Note that the server has its own cap on record batch size which may be different from this

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 1048576
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**partitioner.class** -- Partitioner class that implements the *org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Partitioner* interface

+ TYPE -- class
+ DEFAULT -- org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.DefaultPartitioner
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**receive.buffer.bytes** -- The size of the TCP receive buffer (*SO_RCVBUF*) to use when reading data. If the value is "-1", the OS default will be used

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 32768
+ VALID VALUES -- [-1,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**request.timeout.ms** -- The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted. This should be larger than *replica.lag.time.max.ms* (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 30000
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**sasl.jaas.config** -- JAAS login context parameters for SASL connections in the format used by JAAS configuration files. JAAS configuration file format is described `here <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/LoginConfigFile.html>`_. The format for the value is: "(=)*;"

+ TYPE -- password
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**sasl.kerberos.service.name** -- The Kerberos principal name that ADS runs as. This can be defined either in ADS's JAAS config or in ADS's config

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**sasl.mechanism** -- SASL mechanism used for client connections. This may be any mechanism for which a security provider is available. GSSAPI is the default mechanism

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- GSSAPI
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**security.protocol** -- Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Valid values are: "PLAINTEXT", "SSL", "SASL_PLAINTEXT", "SASL_SSL"

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- PLAINTEXT
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**send.buffer.bytes** -- The size of the TCP send buffer (*SO_SNDBUF*) to use when sending data. If the value is "-1", the OS default will be used

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 131072
+ VALID VALUES -- [-1,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**ssl.enabled.protocols** -- The list of protocols enabled for SSL connections

+ TYPE -- list
+ DEFAULT -- TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**ssl.keystore.type** -- The file format of the key store file. This is optional for client

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- JKS
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**ssl.protocol** -- The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. Default setting is "TLS", which is fine for most cases. Allowed values in recent JVMs are "TLS", "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2". "SSL", "SSLv2" and "SSLv3" may be supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- TLS
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**ssl.provider** --The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- null

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- JKS
+ IMPORTANCE -- medium

**enable.idempotence** -- When set to "true", the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If "false", producer retries due to broker failures, etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Note that enabling idempotence requires *max.in.flight.requests.per.connection* to be less than or equal to "5", retries to be greater than "0" and acks must be "all". If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values will be chosen. If incompatible values are set, a *ConfigException* will be thrown

+ TYPE -- boolean
+ DEFAULT -- false
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**interceptor.classes** -- A list of classes to use as interceptors. Implementing the *org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerInterceptor* interface allows you to intercept (and possibly mutate) the records received by the producer before they are published to the ADS cluster. By default, there are no interceptors

+ TYPE -- list
+ DEFAULT -- ""
+ VALID VALUES -- org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigDef$NonNullValidator@6a41eaa2
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**max.in.flight.requests.per.connection** -- The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking. Note that if this setting is set to be greater than "1" and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (i.e., if retries are enabled)

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 5
+ VALID VALUES -- [1,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**metadata.max.age.ms** -- The period of time in milliseconds after which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new brokers or partitions

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 300000
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**metric.reporters** -- A list of classes to use as metrics reporters. Implementing the *org.apache.kafka.common.metrics.MetricsReporter* interface allows plugging in classes that will be notified of new metric creation. The JmxReporter is always included to register JMX statistics

+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**metrics.sample.window.ms** -- The window of time a metrics sample is computed over

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 30000
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**reconnect.backoff.max.ms** -- The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait when reconnecting to a broker that has repeatedly failed to connect. If provided, the backoff per host will increase exponentially for each consecutive connection failure, up to this maximum. After calculating the backoff increase, *20%* random jitter is added to avoid connection storms

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 1000
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**reconnect.backoff.ms** -- The base amount of time to wait before attempting to reconnect to a given host. This avoids repeatedly connecting to a host in a tight loop. This backoff applies to all connection attempts by the client to a broker

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 50
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**retry.backoff.ms** -- The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios

+ TYPE -- long	
+ DEFAULT -- 100
+ VALID VALUES -- [0,...]
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd** -- Kerberos kinit command path

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- /usr/bin/kinit
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**sasl.kerberos.min.time.before.relogin** -- Login thread sleep time between refresh attempts

+ TYPE -- long
+ DEFAULT -- 60000
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

+ TYPE -- double
+ DEFAULT -- 0.05
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**sasl.kerberos.ticket.renew.window.factor** -- Login thread will sleep until the specified window factor of time from last refresh to ticket's expiry has been reached, at which time it will try to renew the ticket

+ TYPE -- double
+ DEFAULT -- 0.8
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**ssl.cipher.suites** -- A list of cipher suites. This is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol. By default all the available cipher suites are supported

+ TYPE -- list
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm** -- The endpoint identification algorithm to validate server hostname using server certificate

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**ssl.keymanager.algorithm** -- The algorithm used by key manager factory for SSL connections. Default value is the key manager factory algorithm configured for the Java Virtual Machine

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- SunX509
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**ssl.secure.random.implementation** -- The SecureRandom PRNG implementation to use for SSL cryptography operations

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**ssl.trustmanager.algorithm** -- The algorithm used by trust manager factory for SSL connections. Default value is the trust manager factory algorithm configured for the Java Virtual Machine

+ TYPE -- string	
+ DEFAULT -- PKIX
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**transaction.timeout.ms** -- The maximum amount of time in ms that the transaction coordinator will wait for a transaction status update from the producer before proactively aborting the ongoing transaction.If this value is larger than the *transaction.max.timeout.ms* setting in the broker, the request will fail with a *InvalidTransactionTimeout* error

+ TYPE -- int
+ DEFAULT -- 60000
+ IMPORTANCE -- low

**transactional.id** -- The *TransactionalId* to use for transactional delivery. This enables reliability semantics which span multiple producer sessions since it allows the client to guarantee that transactions using the same *TransactionalId* have been completed prior to starting any new transactions. If no *TransactionalId* is provided, then the producer is limited to idempotent delivery. Note that *enable.idempotence* must be enabled if a *TransactionalId* is configured. The default is "null", which means transactions cannot be used. Note that transactions requires a cluster of at least three brokers by default what is the recommended setting for production; for development you can change this, by adjusting broker setting *transaction.state.log.replication.factor*

+ TYPE -- string
+ DEFAULT -- null
+ VALID VALUES -- non-empty string
+ IMPORTANCE -- low
